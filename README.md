### Project Description:
Assignment 5 allowed us to continue to learn and develop skills utilizing JavaScript. The Tax Calculator application was used to calculate a person’s total income tax and their appropriate tax bracket. To calculate the tax amount, variables were created first for the actual amount and the tax rate. If, if/else, and nested if statements were used to calculate the results. Within each of the four sections (single, married jointly, married separately, and head of household), the tax brackets were broken down into equations to calculate the actual income tax amount. The document.getElementById.value method is used to collect the user’s entered values, calculate the tax amount and rate, and display the results. The getElementById() method is used to locate where the tax results and correct bracket appear. The document.getElementById method was also used to find and overwrite the element, which removes the calculations when the ‘Clear Calculator’ button is clicked.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A concept I learned in this lesson is how to create and read arrays utilized in JavaScript. Arrays are a set of data represented by a single variable name. Each piece of data contained in an array is an element, and each element’s numeric position within the array is known as the index. The index number for each array begins at 0. Arrays can be created without any elements and can be added later, as size can change dynamically.

2. A concept I learned in this lesson is what if statements are and how they are utilized for decision-making. We learned of four types including if, if/else, and nested if(/else) or else/if. If statements are used to execute specific programming code if it returns a truth value. If/else statements execute one action if the condition is true and another if the condition is false. A nested if or nested if/else statement is one decision-making statement that contains another decision-making statement. Else/if statements are a more compact version of the if/else statements that are easier to read and shorter in length.

3. A concept I learned in this lesson is what a function is and how to utilize them. Functions are a related group of JavaScript statements that are executed as a single unit. They are the same as methods, but are not associated with an object and must be within a script element. A function will contain parameters and statements. There are two types of functions: named and anonymous. Named functions are related statements given a name, must be called to execute it, and are reusable, while anonymous functions have no assigned name, can only be used once, and only work where they are located.
